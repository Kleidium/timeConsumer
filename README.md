# timeConsumer
This MWSE mod passes time when enchanting, repairing, performing alchemy, making and learning spells, bartering, talking, and looting. Can be used alone for immersion or with other mods that introduce time sensitive mechanics such as hunger and thirst. Each feature is modular and can be toggled on or off through the MCM.
